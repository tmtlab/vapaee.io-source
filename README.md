- ### Easy bugs
  - [x] there's a bug when calculating the payment
  - [x] the total number of buy orders always displays: 0 orders - 0.0000 TLOS
  - [x] do not show the resource panels or balance when not logged in and with low resolution
  - [x] tokens with more volume should be shown on top on the token list
  - [x] in the _order editor panel_ the loading of the cancels do not correspond well. (buy orders are mixed with sell orders)
  - [x] in the _order editor panel_ sometime own order don't appear. It should update regularly as _history panel_ does.
- ### Hard bugs
  - [x] review the list of own orders within the _order editor panel_ because it doesn't display properly sometimes
  - [x] check the login button.
    - [ ] show error messages!
    - [x] throw errors in console
    - [ ] verify if the user does have Telos mainnet configured in the wallet.
  - [x] At the moment infinite listeners are being added to the onresize event but I am not taking them out. They accumulate and degrade the performance, badly.

  - [x] remember the last market visited (in memory) and make the 'Trade' nav button to go there instead allways to CNT/TLOS
  - [ ] add date in history entries
